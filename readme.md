# Stencil Podcaster App

Pain points:
* Can't use properties beginnig with is* (example: _isLoading_ must be only _loading_)
* Can't have non TypeScript files working. I updated the _tsconfig.json_ file with _allowJs_ attribute but it dodn't work
* Problems understanding how to use router: hot to get URL parameters in the components
